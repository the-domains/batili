Wait, what? Also, if you have kids and if they are attending to a modernish school, I am sure you observe the new weird things from the school like all these “abstract” homeworks, and buzzy sounding concepts like “exactness”. Well, give it some credit, because alumni of this education system include Jeff Bezos, Sergey Brin and Larry Page (true story). My head is exploding now, being happy, Candy Crush and Amazon & Google Guys. What is the common element?</p><p>These guys attended schools that are based on<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMontessori_education&t=MzEyY2M5MDZhZWY2YjViMTU4NjY2N2JiZjVlNzZkYzBkYWUxMDM2MSxnaUtJRlo1Sw%3D%3D" title="Montessori Education System">Montessori</a>principles, that are built upon putting the students in a continous Flow state, that is the concept the coined by MrC. Imagine, you are going to school everday just to be in Flow.</p><p>You remember how Walter White was happily cooking Meth in his lab, he was in Flow state; remember how Antonio Salieri happily humming and creating average music until Amadeus arriving town? He was in Flow. For me, I am definitely in Flow when snowboarding down thru a lonely trail with<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2FLots+of+Melancholy&t=MjU0YmI3NGExMTgwYTJkM2EzZjE4Mjg0MzFhMDcxYTdlNjljN2QyYyxnaUtJRlo1Sw%3D%3D" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLW22B5R3Mc">A Letter to Elise</a>.</p><p>Now, I will give you tl;dr version of key elements of the Flow state, right here, right now and you will not need the read the book itself or the surrounding doctorate material.</p><p>But Before I give you these 8 points, you must understand that when MrC was conducting experiments on the subject, he covered a lot of bases. The spectrum of activities was vast, and also the test subjects were from all different backgrounds, countries, social class, age or gender. Nevertheless, elderly Koreans, or members of motorcycle gangs shared very very similar moments. Aha! That is really something, and MrC calls this<strong>Optimal Experience</strong>, that is also the title of his<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFlow-The-Psychology-Optimal-Experience%2Fdp%2F0061339202&t=Yzc4NTk0OTJjNzNlN2RmYmQ4YWIwMjBkZGYzYzgzY2YwMzliZWI1NSxnaUtJRlo1Sw%3D%3D" title="Flow - Optimal Experience" target="_blank">book</a>. </p><ol><li>Experience occurs when you are faced with tasks that you have a chance of completing. </li><li>We need quality time to concentrate.</li><li>Clear objectives. </li><li>Immediate feedback.</li><li>Immersion; you are so in it, you forget the pains of everyday life.</li><li>Development of sense of controlling your actions.</li><li>Concern for self disappears.</li><li>Sense of duration of time is disappeared.</li></ol><p>Now think of your favorite mobile game (Candy Crush, Cut the Rope, Angry Birds, etc), and read the above again.</p><p>Now you understand the addictive nature, because we all want to be in a Flow state. </p><p>I do not imply here, lets play games all the time and be happy. That is not the answer, as we all know, that fix is a short lived one.</p><p>To truly find your Optimal Experience, you need to reflect and think about yourself. </p><p><strong>When are you in the Flow?</strong></p><picture>
